# DHCP Monitoring Frontend Foundation - Technical Plan

## Brief Description

Build the foundational structure for a React-based DHCP Monitoring Frontend application that will provide a real-time interface for monitoring DHCP lease information. This foundation includes project setup, core architecture, component structure, and routing without implementing the actual DHCP lease monitoring functionality or API communication. The foundation will support the product brief requirements including React with Vite, TypeScript, TanStack Router/Query, Tailwind CSS with Radix UI, with API integration to be implemented in a subsequent feature.

## Files and Functions to Create

### Project Configuration Files
- `package.json` - Project dependencies and scripts with React, Vite, TypeScript, TanStack Router/Query, Tailwind CSS, Radix UI, Zod
- `tsconfig.json` - TypeScript configuration with strict mode and path mapping
- `tsconfig.node.json` - Node-specific TypeScript configuration for Vite
- `vite.config.ts` - Vite build configuration with path aliases and development server setup
- `tailwind.config.js` - Tailwind CSS configuration with Radix UI integration
- `postcss.config.js` - PostCSS configuration for Tailwind processing
- `.gitignore` - Git ignore patterns for Node.js, TypeScript, and build artifacts
- `index.html` - Main HTML entry point with app root element
- `pnpm-lock.yaml` - Auto-generated dependency lock file

### Source Code Structure
- `src/main.tsx` - Application entry point with React render and router setup
- `src/App.tsx` - Root application component with layout structure
- `src/index.css` - Global styles with Tailwind CSS imports
- `src/vite-env.d.ts` - Vite environment type declarations

### Type Safety and Utilities
- `src/types/app.ts` - Application-specific type definitions (SortConfig, FilterState, etc.)
- `src/lib/utils.ts` - Utility functions for data formatting and common operations
- Note: API types and communication layer out of scope for foundation

### Core Components Structure
- `src/components/ui/` - Radix UI wrapper components (Button, Table, Input, etc.)
- `src/components/layout/Layout.tsx` - Main application layout component
- `src/components/dhcp/` - DHCP-specific components directory (placeholder for future features)
- `src/components/common/` - Shared components (LoadingSpinner, ErrorBoundary, etc.)

### Routing and Pages
- `src/routes/` - TanStack Router route definitions
- `src/routes/__root.tsx` - Root route component with layout
- `src/routes/index.tsx` - Home page route (DHCP lease table page)
- `src/routes/about.tsx` - About page route for application information

### State Management Setup
- `src/hooks/` - Custom React hooks directory
- `src/hooks/use-local-storage.ts` - Hook for persistent user preferences
- Note: TanStack Query setup and API queries out of scope for foundation

### Development and Build Configuration
- `.env.example` - Environment variable template
- `.env.local` - Local development environment variables (git-ignored)
- `public/` - Static assets directory
- `dist/` - Build output directory (git-ignored)

## Step-by-Step Implementation Algorithm

### Phase 1: Project Setup and Build System
1. Initialize project structure with proper directory hierarchy
2. Configure package.json with required dependencies (React, Vite, TypeScript, TanStack Router, Tailwind CSS, Radix UI)
3. Set up TypeScript configuration with strict mode and path mapping for clean imports
4. Configure Vite build system with development server, path aliases, and TypeScript support
5. Configure Tailwind CSS with PostCSS integration and Radix UI theme setup
6. Create git ignore file with Node.js, TypeScript, and build artifact patterns
7. Set up basic environment variable structure for development settings
8. Note: API communication dependencies (TanStack Query, Zod) and integration out of scope

### Phase 2: Core Application Architecture
1. Create main HTML entry point with React root element and basic meta tags
2. Implement main.tsx with React StrictMode and router provider setup
3. Build root App component with basic layout structure and routing outlet
4. Configure TanStack Router with proper route definitions and type safety
5. Set up global CSS with Tailwind imports and base application styles
6. Create root route component with error boundary and layout wrapper

### Phase 3: UI Foundation and Utilities
1. Create utility functions for data formatting and common operations
2. Set up application-specific type definitions (SortConfig, FilterState, etc.)
3. Implement custom hooks for localStorage integration (user preferences)
4. Note: API types, communication layer, and data fetching out of scope

### Phase 4: Component Architecture and UI Foundation
1. Create Radix UI wrapper components (Button, Table, Input, Select) with Tailwind styling
2. Build main Layout component with header, navigation, and content areas
3. Implement error boundary component for graceful error handling
4. Create loading spinner component for future async operations
5. Set up component directory structure for future DHCP lease features
6. Build placeholder components for lease table, search, and sort controls

### Phase 5: Routing and Navigation
1. Set up route definitions for home page (lease table) and about page
2. Implement basic navigation between routes with proper TypeScript support
3. Create route components with proper layout integration
4. Note: State management for API data out of scope

### Phase 6: Development Experience and Build Process
1. Configure development server with hot module replacement for efficient development workflow
2. Configure build process with proper asset optimization and type checking
3. Create development scripts for linting, type checking, and building
4. Set up environment variable handling for different deployment environments
5. Configure proper source maps and debugging support
6. Note: Backend API proxy configuration out of scope

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core Foundation (Priority 1)
- Project setup and build configuration
- TypeScript and type safety infrastructure
- Basic React application structure with routing

### Phase 2: UI Component Foundation (Priority 2)
- Radix UI component wrappers
- Layout and navigation structure
- Basic styling with Tailwind CSS

### Phase 3: Development Environment (Priority 3)
- Development server configuration
- Build process optimization
- Environment variable management

Note: API integration, data fetching, and real-time communication will be implemented as separate features

This foundation provides a complete, type-safe, modern React application structure that supports the core architectural requirements from the product brief while remaining ready for future feature implementation. The architecture emphasizes type safety, maintainable code organization, and follows React and TypeScript best practices. API communication, data fetching, and real-time capabilities will be implemented as separate subsequent features.
