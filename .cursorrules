- Tech stack: React + Vite + TypeScript + TanStack Router + TanStack Query + Tailwind (+ Radix UI) + Zod + OpenAPI-generated types/client, running on Kubernetes in production.
- Use `pnmp` as the package manager.
- Use a functional programming style; no OOP.
- Don't start the app yourself.
- Keep .gitignore files as brief as possible.
- Don't add code that may be useful in the future like helper methods or scaffolding. Only write code that is of use for the feature being implemented.
